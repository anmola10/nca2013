<p align="justify">(1) The articles of a company  may confer on its Board of Directors the power to appoint any person, other  than a person who fails to get appointed as a director in a general meeting, as  an additional director at any time who shall hold office up to the date of the  next annual general meeting or the last date on which the annual general meeting  should have been held, whichever is earlier.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The Board of Directors of a  company may, if so authorised by its articles or by a resolution passed by the  company in general meeting, appoint a person, not being a person holding any  alternate directorship for any other director in the company, to act as an  alternate director for a director during his absence for a period of not less  than three months from India:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that no person shall be appointed as an  alternate director for an independent director unless he is qualified to be  appointed as an independent director under the provisions of this Act:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided  further</strong> that an alternate director shall not hold office  for a period longer than that permissible to the director in whose place he has  been appointed and shall vacate the office if and when the director in whose  place he has been appointed returns to India:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided also </strong>that if the term of office of the original  director is determined before he so returns to India, any provision for the  automatic re-appointment of retiring directors in default of another  appointment shall apply to the original, and not to the alternate director.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Subject to the articles of  a company, the Board may appoint any person as a director nominated by any  institution in pursuance of the provisions of any law for the time being in  force or of any agreement or by the Central Government or the State Government  by virtue of its shareholding in a Government company.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) In the case of a public  company, if the office of any director appointed by the company in general  meeting is vacated before his term of office expires in the normal course, the  resulting casual vacancy may, in default of and subject to any regulations in  the articles of the company, be filled by the Board of Directors at a meeting  of the Board:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that any person so appointed shall hold office  only up to the date up to which the director in whose place he is appointed would  have held office if it had not been vacated.</p>
