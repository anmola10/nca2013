<blockquote><p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) all offences under this Act shall be  triable only by the Special Court established for the area in which the  registered office of the company in relation to which the offence is committed  or where there are more Special Courts than one for such area, by such one of  them as may be specified in this behalf by the High Court concerned;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) where a person accused of, or  suspected of the commission of, an offence under this Act is forwarded to a  Magistrate under sub-section (2) or sub-section (2A) of section 167 of the Code  of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), such Magistrate may authorise the  detention of such person in such custody as he thinks fit for a period not  exceeding fifteen days in the whole where such Magistrate is a Judicial  Magistrate and seven days in the whole where such Magistrate is an Executive  Magistrate:<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that where such Magistrate considers that the detention of such person  upon or before the expiry of the period of detention is unnecessary, he shall  order such person to be forwarded to the Special Court having jurisdiction;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) the Special Court may exercise, in  relation to the person forwarded to it under clause (<em>b</em>), the same power  which a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try a case may exercise under section  167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) in relation to an  accused person who has been forwarded to him under that section; and<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>d</em>) a Special Court may, upon perusal of  the police report of the facts constituting an offence under this Act or upon a  complaint in that behalf, take cognizance of that offence without the accused  being committed to it for trial.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) When trying an offence  under this Act, a Special Court may also try an offence other than an offence  under this Act with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973 (2 of 1974) be charged at the same trial.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Notwithstanding anything  contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), the Special  Court may, if it thinks fit, try in a summary way any offence under this Act  which is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that in the case of any conviction in a summary  trial, no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year shall be  passed:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided  further</strong> that when at the commencement of, or in the  course of, a summary trial, it appears to the Special Court that the nature of  the case is such that the sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one  year may have to be passed or that it is, for any other reason, undesirable to  try the case summarily, the Special Court shall, after hearing the parties,  record an order to that effect and thereafter recall any witnesses who may have  been examined and proceed to hear or rehear the case in accordance with the  procedure for the regular trial.</p>
