<h2><a name="_Toc388885267" id="_Toc388885267">325.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application  of insolvency rules in winding up of insolvent companies.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) In the winding up of  an insolvent company, the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard  to&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) debts  provable;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) the  valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities; and<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) the  respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors,<br />
    as are in force for the  time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons  adjudged insolvent:<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that the security of every secured creditor shall be deemed to be  subject to a <em>pari passu </em>charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of  the workmen's portion therein, and, where a secured creditor, instead of  relinquishing his security and proving his debts, opts to realise his  security,&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>i</em>) the  liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) any  amount realised by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge shall be  applied rateably for the discharge of workmen's dues; and<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) so much  of the debts due to such secured creditor as could not be realised by him or  the amount of the workmen's portion in his security, whichever is less, shall  rank <em>pari passu </em>with the workmen's dues for the purposes of section 326.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) All persons under  sub-section (1) shall be entitled to prove and receive dividends out of the  assets of the company under winding up, and make such claims against the  company as they respectively are entitled to make by virtue of this section:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that if a secured creditor, instead of relinquishing his security  and proving his debts, proceeds to realise his security, he shall be liable to  pay his portion of the expenses incurred by the liquidator, including a  provisional liquidator, if any, for the preservation of the security before its  realisation by the secured creditor.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><em>Explanation</em>.&mdash;For the purposes of this sub-section, the portion of expenses  incurred by the liquidator for the preservation of a security which the secured  creditor shall be liable to pay shall be the whole of the expenses less an  amount which bears to such expenses the same proportion as the workmen's  portion in relation to the security bears to the value of the security.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) For the purposes of  this section, section 326 and section 327,&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>)  &quot;workmen'', in relation to a company, means the employees of the company,  being workmen within the meaning of clause (<em>s</em>) of section 2 of the  Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947);<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>)  &quot;workmen's dues'', in relation to a company, means the aggregate of the  following sums due from the company to its workmen, namely:&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>i</em>) all wages  or salary including wages payable for time or piece work and salary earned  wholly or in part by way of commission of any workman in respect of services  rendered to the company and any compensation payable to any workman under any  of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947);<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) all  accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any workman or, in the case of  his death, to any other person in his right on the termination of his  employment before or by the effect of the winding up order or resolution;<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) unless  the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the purposes of  reconstruction or amalgamation with another company or unless the company has,  at the commencement of the winding up, under such a contract with insurers as  is mentioned in section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923),  rights capable of being transferred to and vested in the workmen, all amount  due in respect of any compensation or liability for compensation under the said  Act in respect of the death or disablement of any workman of the company;<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iv</em>) all sums  due to any workman from the provident fund, the pension fund, the gratuity fund  or any other fund for the welfare of the workmen, maintained by the company;<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(<em>c</em>)  &quot;workmen's portion'', in relation to the security of any secured creditor  of a company, means the amount which bears to the value of the security the  same proportion as the amount of the workmen's dues bears to the aggregate of  the amount of workmen's dues and the amount of the debts due to the secured  creditors.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><em>Illustration</em> <br />
  The value of the security  of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1,00,000. The total amount of the  workmen's dues is Rs. 1,00,000. The amount of the debts due from the company to  its secured creditors is Rs. 3,00,000. The aggregate of the amount of workmen's  dues and the amount of debts due to secured creditors is Rs. 4,00,000. The  workmen's portion of the security is, therefore, one-fourth of the value of the  security, that is Rs. 25,000.</p>
