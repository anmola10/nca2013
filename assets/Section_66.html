</p>
<p align="justify">(8) Where the name of any  creditor entitled to object to the reduction of share capital under this  section is, by reason of his ignorance of the proceedings for reduction or of  their nature and effect with respect to his debt or claim, not entered on the  list of creditors, and after such reduction, the company is unable, within the  meaning of sub-section (2) of section 271, to pay the amount of his debt or  claim,&mdash;<br />
