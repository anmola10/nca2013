<h2><a name="_Toc388885269" id="_Toc388885269">327.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preferential payments.</a> </h2>
<p>(1) In a winding up, subject to  the provisions of section 326, there shall be paid in priority to all other  debts,&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates  due from the company to the Central Government or a State Government or to a  local authority at the relevant date, and having become due and payable within  the twelve months immediately before that date;<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) all wages or salary including wages  payable for time or piece work and salary earned wholly or in part by way of  commission of any employee in respect of services rendered to the company and  due for a period not exceeding four months within the twelve months immediately  before the relevant date, subject to the condition that the amount payable  under this clause to any workman shall not exceed such amount as may be  notified;<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) all accrued holiday remuneration  becoming payable to any employee, or in the case of his death, to any other  person claiming under him, on the termination of his employment before, or by  the winding up order, or, as the case may be, the dissolution of the company;<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>d</em>) unless the company is being wound up  voluntarily merely for the purposes of reconstruction or amalgamation with  another company, all amount due in respect of contributions payable during the  period of twelve months immediately before the relevant date by the company as  the employer of persons under the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 (34 of  1948) or any other law for the time being in force;<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>e</em>) unless the company has, at the  commencement of winding up, under such a contract with any insurer as is  mentioned in section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923),  rights capable of being transferred to and vested in the workmen, all amount  due in respect of any compensation or liability for compensation under the said  Act in respect of the death or disablement of any employee of the company:<br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Provided</strong> that where any compensation under the said Act is a weekly payment, the  amount payable under this clause shall be taken to be the amount of the lump  sum for which such weekly payment could, if redeemable, be redeemed, if the  employer has made an application under that Act;<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>f</em>) all sums due to any employee from the  provident fund, the pension fund, the gratuity fund or any other fund for the  welfare of the employees, maintained by the company; and<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>g</em>) the expenses of any investigation held  in pursuance of sections 213 and 216, in so far as they are payable by the  company.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2) Where any payment has been  made to any employee of a company on account of wages or salary or accrued  holiday remuneration, himself or, in the case of his death, to any other person  claiming through him, out of money advanced by some person for that purpose,  the person by whom the money was advanced shall, in a winding up, have a right  of priority in respect of the money so advanced and paid, up to the amount by  which the sum in respect of which the employee or other person in his right  would have been entitled to priority in the winding up has been reduced by  reason of the payment having been made.<br />
  </p>
<p>(3) The debts enumerated in  this section shall&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) rank equally among themselves and be  paid in full, unless the assets are insufficient to meet them, in which case  they shall abate in equal proportions; and<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) so far as the assets of the company  available for payment to general creditors are insufficient to meet them, have  priority over the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge  created by the company, and be paid accordingly out of any property comprised  in or subject to that charge.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(4) Subject to the retention of  such sums as may be necessary for the costs and expenses of the winding up, the  debts under this section shall be discharged forthwith so far as the assets are  sufficient to meet them, and in the case of the debts to which priority is  given under clause (<em>d</em>) of sub-section (1), formal proof thereof shall  not be required except in so far as may be otherwise <a href="rule_20.html">prescribed</a>.<br />
  </p>
<p>(5) In the event of a landlord  or other person distraining or having distrained on any goods or effects of the  company within three months immediately before the date of a winding up order,  the debts to which priority is given under this section shall be a first charge  on the goods or effects so distrained on or the proceeds of the sale thereof:<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Provided</strong> that, in respect of any money paid under any  such charge, the landlord or other person shall have the same rights of priority  as the person to whom the payment is made.<br />
  </p>
<p>(6) Any remuneration in respect  of a period of holiday or of absence from work on medical grounds through  sickness or other good cause shall be deemed to be wages in respect of services  rendered to the company during that period.<br />
  </p>
<p><em>Explanation.</em>&mdash;For the purposes of this section,&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) the expression &quot;accrued holiday  remuneration&quot; includes, in relation to any person, all sums which, by  virtue either of his contract of employment or of any enactment including any  order made or direction given thereunder, are payable on account of the  remuneration which would, in the ordinary course, have become payable to him in  respect of a period of holiday, had his employment with the company continued  until he became entitled to be allowed the holiday;<br />
  </p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) the expression &quot;employee&quot;  does not include a workman; and<br />
  </p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) the expression &quot;relevant  date&quot; means&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>i</em>) in the case of a company being wound  up by the Tribunal, the date of appointment or first appointment of a  provisional liquidator, or if no such appointment was made, the date of the  winding up order, unless, in either case, the company had commenced to be wound  up voluntarily before that date; and<br />
  </p>
  <p>(<em>ii</em>) in any other case, the date of the  passing of the resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company.</p>
