<h2><a name="_Toc388885273" id="_Toc388885273">331.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liabilities  and rights of certain persons fraudulently preferred.</a> </h2>
<p align="justify">(1) Where a company is being  wound up and anything made, taken or done after the commencement of this Act is  invalid under section 328 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in  property mortgaged or charged to secure the company's debt, then, without  prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising, apart from this provision, the  person preferred shall be subject to the same liabilities, and shall have the  same rights, as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as a surety for  the debt, to the extent of the mortgage or charge on the property or the value  of his interest, whichever is less.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The value of the interest  of the person preferred under sub-section (1) shall be determined as at the  date of the transaction constituting the fraudulent preference, as if the  interest were free of all encumbrances other than those to which the mortgage  or charge for the debt of the company was then subject.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) On an application made to  the Tribunal with respect to any payment on the ground that the payment was a  fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the Tribunal shall have  jurisdiction to determine any questions with respect to the payment arising  between the person to whom the payment was made and the surety or guarantor and  to grant relief in respect thereof, notwithstanding that it is not necessary so  to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose, may give leave to  bring in the surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of a suit for  the recovery of the sum paid.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) The provisions of  sub-section (3) shall apply <em>mutatis mutandis </em>in relation to transactions  other than payment of money.</p>
