<h2><a name="_Toc388885227" id="_Toc388885227">285.  Settlement of list  of contributories and application of assets.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) As soon as may be after the  passing of a winding up order by the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall settle a list  of contributories, cause rectification of register of members in all cases  where rectification is required in pursuance of this Act and shall cause the  assets of the company to be applied for the discharge of its liability:<br />
    </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that where it appears to the Tribunal that it  would not be necessary to make calls on or adjust the rights of contributories,  the Tribunal may dispense with the settlement of a list of contributories.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) In settling the list of  contributories, the Tribunal shall distinguish between those who are  contributories in their own right and those who are contributories as being  representatives of, or liable for the debts of, others.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) While settling the list of  contributories, the Tribunal shall include every person, who is or has been a  member, who shall be liable to contribute to the assets of the company an  amount sufficient for payment of the debts and liabilities and the costs,  charges and expenses of winding up, and for the adjustment of the rights of the  contributories among themselves, subject to the following conditions, namely:&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) a person who has been a member shall  not be liable to contribute if he has ceased to be a member for the preceding  one year or more before the commencement of the winding up;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) a person who has been a member shall  not be liable to contribute in respect of any debt or liability of the company  contracted after he ceased to be a member;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) no person who has been a member shall  be liable to contribute unless it appears to the Tribunal that the present  members are unable to satisfy the contributions required to be made by them in  pursuance of this Act;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>d</em>) in the case of a company limited by  shares, no contribution shall be required from any person, who is or has been a  member exceeding the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares in respect of which  he is liable as such member;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>e</em>) in the case of a company limited by  guarantee, no contribution shall be required from any person, who is or has  been a member exceeding the amount undertaken to be contributed by him to the  assets of the company in the event of its being wound up but if the company has  a share capital, such member shall be liable to contribute to the extent of any  sum unpaid on any shares held by him as if the company were a company limited  by shares.</p>
