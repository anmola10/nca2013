<p align="justify"><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall</p>
<p align="justify">be entitled to receive within two months after incorporation, in case of subscribers to the</p>

<p align="justify">of transfer or transmission or within such other period as the conditions of issue shall be</p>
<p align="justify">provided,&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) one certificate for all his shares without payment of any charges; or</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) several certificates, each for one or more of his shares, upon payment of</p>
<p align="justify">twenty rupees for each certificate after the first.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) Every certificate shall be under the seal and shall specify the shares to which it</p>

<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) In respect of any share or shares held jointly by several persons, the company</p>
<p align="justify">shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a share</p>
<p align="justify">to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) If any share certificate be worn out, defaced, mutilated or torn or if there be no</p>
<p align="justify">further space on the back for endorsement of transfer, then upon production and surrender</p>
<p align="justify">thereof to the company, a new certificate may be issued in lieu thereof, and if any certificate</p>
<p align="justify">is lost or destroyed then upon proof thereof to the satisfaction of the company and on</p>
<p align="justify">execution of such indemnity as the company deem adequate, a new certificate in lieu thereof</p>
<p align="justify">shall be given. Every certificate under this Article shall be issued on payment of</p>
<p align="justify">twenty rupees for each certificate.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The provisions of Articles (<em>2</em>) and (<em>3</em>) shall&nbsp;<em>mutatis mutandis&nbsp;</em>apply to debentures</p>
<p align="justify">of the company.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding</p>
<p align="justify">any share upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by, or be compelled in any</p>
<p align="justify">way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or</p>
<p align="justify">partial interest in any share, or any interest in any fractional part of a share, or (except only as</p>
<p align="justify">by these regulations or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share</p>
<p align="justify">except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) The company may exercise the powers of paying commissions conferred by</p>
<p align="justify">sub-section (<em>6</em>) of section 40, provided that the rate per cent. or the amount of the commission</p>
<p align="justify">paid or agreed to be paid shall be disclosed in the manner required by that section and rules</p>
<p align="justify">made thereunder.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The rate or amount of the commission shall not exceed the rate or amount prescribed</p>
<p align="justify">in rules made under sub-section (6) of section 40.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) The commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully</p>
<p align="justify">or partly paid shares or partly in the one way and partly in the other.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>6</strong>. (<em>i</em>) If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights</p>
<p align="justify">attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that</p>
<p align="justify">class) may, subject to the provisions of section 48, and whether or not the company is being</p>
<p align="justify">wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths of the issued</p>
<p align="justify">shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting</p>
<p align="justify">of the holders of the shares of that class.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) To every such separate meeting, the provisions of these regulations relating to</p>
<p align="justify">general meetings shall&nbsp;<em>mutatis mutandis&nbsp;</em>apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be at</p>
<p align="justify">least two persons holding at least one-third of the issued shares of the class in question.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with</p>
<p align="justify">preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue</p>
<p align="justify">of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares</p>
<p align="justify">ranking&nbsp;<em>pari passu&nbsp;</em>therewith.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>8</strong>. Subject to the provisions of section 55, any preference shares may, with the sanction</p>
<p align="justify">of an ordinary resolution, be issued on the terms that they are to be redeemed on such terms</p>
<p align="justify">and in such manner as the company before the issue of the shares may, by special resolution,</p>
<p align="justify">determine.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>Lien</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) The company shall have a first and paramount lien&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) on every share (not being a fully paid share), for all monies (whether presently</p>
<p align="justify">payable or not) called, or payable at a fixed time, in respect of that share; and</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) on all shares (not being fully paid shares) standing registered in the name of</p>
<p align="justify">a single person, for all monies presently payable by him or his estate to the company:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that the Board of directors may at any time declare any share to be</p>
<p align="justify">wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this clause.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The company&rsquo;s lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable and</p>
<p align="justify">bonuses declared from time to time in respect of such shares.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong>The company may sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit, any shares on which</p>
<p align="justify">the company has a lien:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that no sale shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable; or</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) until the expiration of fourteen days after a notice in writing stating and</p>
<p align="justify">demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is</p>
<p align="justify">presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the</p>
<p align="justify">share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or insolvency.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to transfer</p>
<p align="justify">the shares sold to the purchaser thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such</p>
<p align="justify">transfer.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money,</p>
<p align="justify">nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings</p>
<p align="justify">in reference to the sale.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in</p>
<p align="justify">payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The residue, if any, shall, subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as</p>
<p align="justify">existed upon the shares before the sale, be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the</p>
<p align="justify">date of the sale.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>Calls on shares</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>13.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) The Board may, from time to time, make calls upon the members in respect of any</p>
<p align="justify">monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by</p>
<p align="justify">way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that no call shall exceed one-fourth of the nominal value of the share or be</p>
<p align="justify">payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) Each member shall, subject to receiving at least fourteen days&rsquo; notice specifying</p>
<p align="justify">the time or times and place of payment, pay to the company, at the time or times and place so</p>
<p align="justify">specified, the amount called on his shares.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Board.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>14.&nbsp;</strong>A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the</p>
<p align="justify">Board authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>15.&nbsp;</strong>The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in</p>
<p align="justify">respect thereof.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for</p>
<p align="justify">payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest thereon from the</p>
<p align="justify">day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at ten per cent. per annum</p>
<p align="justify">or at such lower rate, if any, as the Board may determine.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of any such interest wholly or in</p>
<p align="justify">part.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>17.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment</p>
<p align="justify">or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of</p>
<p align="justify">premium, shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be deemed to be a call duly made and</p>
<p align="justify">payable on the date on which by the terms of issue such sum becomes payable.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) In case of non-payment of such sum, all the relevant provisions of these regulations</p>
<p align="justify">as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had</p>
<p align="justify">become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>18.&nbsp;</strong>The Board&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same, all</p>
<p align="justify">or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) upon all or any of the monies so advanced, may (until the same would, but for</p>
<p align="justify">such advance, become presently payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding,</p>
<p align="justify">unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct, twelve per cent.</p>
<p align="justify">per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Board and the member paying the sum</p>
<p align="justify">in advance.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>Transfer of shares</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>19.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed by or</p>
<p align="justify">on behalf of both the transferor and transferee.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The transferor shall be deemed to remain a holder of the share until the name of the</p>
<p align="justify">transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>20.&nbsp;</strong>The Board may, subject to the right of appeal conferred by section 58 decline to</p>
<p align="justify">register&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) the transfer of a share, not being a fully paid share, to a person of whom they</p>
<p align="justify">do not approve; or</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) any transfer of shares on which the company has a lien.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>21.&nbsp;</strong>The Board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) the instrument of transfer is in the form as prescribed in rules made under</p>
<p align="justify">sub-section (<em>1</em>) of section 56;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the shares to</p>
<p align="justify">which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show</p>
<p align="justify">the right of the transferor to make the transfer; and</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>22.&nbsp;</strong>On giving not less than seven days&rsquo; previous notice in accordance with section 91</p>
<p align="justify">and rules made thereunder, the registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and</p>
<p align="justify">for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that such registration shall not be suspended for more than thirty days at</p>
<p align="justify">any one time or for more than forty-five days in the aggregate in any year.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>Transmission of shares</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>23.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) On the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the member was a</p>
<p align="justify">joint holder, and his nominee or nominees or legal representatives where he was a sole</p>
<p align="justify">holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his</p>
<p align="justify">interest in the shares.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) Nothing in clause (<em>i</em>) shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any</p>
<p align="justify">liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>24</strong>. (<em>i</em>) Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or</p>
<p align="justify">insolvency of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time</p>
<p align="justify">properly be required by the Board and subject as hereinafter provided, elect, either&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) to be registered himself as holder of the share; or</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) to make such transfer of the share as the deceased or insolvent member could</p>
<p align="justify">have made.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) The Board shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration</p>
<p align="justify">as it would have had, if the deceased or insolvent member had transferred the share before</p>
<p align="justify">his death or insolvency.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>25.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered as holder of the</p>
<p align="justify">share himself, he shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him</p>
<p align="justify">stating that he so elects.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) If the person aforesaid shall elect to transfer the share, he shall testify his election</p>
<p align="justify">by executing a transfer of the share.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these regulations relating to the</p>
<p align="justify">right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such</p>
<p align="justify">notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or insolvency of the member had not occurred</p>
<p align="justify">and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>26.&nbsp;</strong>A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or insolvency of the</p>
<p align="justify">holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be</p>
<p align="justify">entitled if he were the registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being</p>
<p align="justify">registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right</p>
<p align="justify">conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the company:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that the Board may, at any time, give notice requiring any such person to</p>
<p align="justify">elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share, and if the notice is not complied</p>
<p align="justify">with within ninety days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses</p>
<p align="justify">or other monies payable in respect of the share, until the requirements of the notice have</p>
<p align="justify">been complied with.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>27.&nbsp;</strong>In case of a One Person Company&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>i</em>) on the death of the sole member, the person nominated by such member shall</p>
<p align="justify">be the person recognised by the company as having title to all the shares of the</p>
<p align="justify">member;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) the nominee on becoming entitled to such shares in case of the member&rsquo;s</p>
<p align="justify">death shall be informed of such event by the Board of the company;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) such nominee shall be entitled to the same dividends and other rights and</p>
<p align="justify">liabilities to which such sole member of the company was entitled or liable;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>iv</em>) on becoming member, such nominee shall nominate any other person with</p>
<p align="justify">the prior written consent of such person who, shall in the event of the death of the</p>
<p align="justify">member, become the member of the company.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>Forfeiture of shares</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>28.&nbsp;</strong>If a member fails to pay any call, or instalment of a call, on the day appointed for</p>
<p align="justify">payment thereof, the Board may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call</p>
<p align="justify">or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call</p>
<p align="justify">or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>29.&nbsp;</strong>The notice aforesaid shall&mdash;</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) name a further day (not being earlier than the expiry of fourteen days from</p>
<p align="justify">the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice</p>
<p align="justify">is to be made; and</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) state that, in the event of non-payment on or before the day so named, the</p>
<p align="justify">shares in respect of which the call was made shall be liable to be forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>30.&nbsp;</strong>If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any</p>
<p align="justify">share in respect of which the notice has been given may, at any time thereafter, before the</p>
<p align="justify">payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to</p>
<p align="justify">that effect.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>31.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in</p>
<p align="justify">such manner as the Board thinks fit.</p>
<p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) At any time before a sale or disposal as aforesaid, the Board may cancel the</p>
<p align="justify">forfeiture on such terms as it thinks fit.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>32.&nbsp;</strong>(<em>i</em>) A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in</p>
<p align="justify">respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding the forfeiture, remain liable to pay</p>
<p align="justify">to the company all monies which, at the date of forfeiture, were presently payable by him to</p>
