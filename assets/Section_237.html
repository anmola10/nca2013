<p align="justify">(1) Where the Central  Government is satisfied that it is essential in the public interest that two or  more companies should amalgamate, the Central Government may, by order notified  in the Official Gazette, provide for the amalgamation of those companies into a  single company with such constitution, with such property, powers, rights,  interests, authorities and privileges, and with such liabilities, duties and  obligations, as may be specified in the order.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The order under sub-section  (1) may also provide for the continuation by or against the transferee company  of any legal proceedings pending by or against any transferor company and such  consequential, incidental and supplemental provisions as may, in the opinion of  the Central Government, be necessary to give effect to the amalgamation.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Every member or creditor,  including a debenture holder, of each of the transferor companies before the  amalgamation shall have, as nearly as may be, the same interest in or rights  against the transferee company as he had in the company of which he was  originally a member or creditor, and in case the interest or rights of such  member or creditor in or against the transferee company are less than his  interest in or rights against the original company, he shall be entitled to  compensation to that extent, which shall be assessed by such authority as may  be <a href="rule_15.html">prescribed</a> and every such assessment shall be published in the Official  Gazette, and the compensation so assessed shall be paid to the member or  creditor concerned by the transferee company.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Any person aggrieved by any  assessment of compensation made by the <a href="rule_15.html">prescribed</a> authority under sub-section  (3) may, within a period of thirty days from the date of publication of such  assessment in the Official Gazette, prefer an appeal to the Tribunal and  thereupon the assessment of the compensation shall be made by the Tribunal.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(5) No order shall be made  under this section unless&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) a copy of the proposed order has been  sent in draft to each of the companies concerned;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) the time for preferring an appeal  under sub-section (4) has expired, or where any such appeal has been preferred,  the appeal has been finally disposed off; and<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) the Central Government has considered,  and made such modifications, if any, in the draft order as it may deem fit in  the light of suggestions and objections which may be received by it from any  such company within such period as the Central Government may fix in that  behalf, not being less than two months from the date on which the copy  aforesaid is received by that company, or from any class of shareholders  therein, or from any creditors or any class of creditors thereof.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(6) The copies of every order  made under this section shall, as soon as may be after it has been made, be  laid before each House of Parliament.</p>
