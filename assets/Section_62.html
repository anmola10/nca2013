</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) to  persons who, at the date of the offer, are holders of equity shares of the  company in proportion, as nearly as circumstances admit, to the paid-up share  capital on those shares by sending a letter of offer subject to the following  conditions, namely:&mdash;<br />
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">(<em>i</em>) the offer  shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered and limiting a  time not being less than fifteen days and not exceeding thirty days from the  date of the offer within which the offer, if not accepted, shall be deemed to  have been declined;<br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(<em>ii</em>) unless  the articles of the company otherwise provide, the offer aforesaid shall be  deemed to include a right exercisable by the person concerned to renounce the  shares offered to him or any of them in favour of any other person; and the  notice referred to in clause (<em>i</em>) shall contain a statement of this  right;<br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(<em>iii</em>) after  the expiry of the time specified in the notice aforesaid, or on receipt of  earlier intimation from the person to whom such notice is given that he  declines to accept the shares offered, the Board of Directors may dispose of  them in such manner which is not dis-advantageous to the shareholders and the  company;<br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) to  employees under a scheme of employees' stock option, subject to special  resolution passed by company and subject to such conditions as may be  <a href="rule_4.html">prescribed</a>; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) to any  persons, if it is authorised by a special resolution, whether or not those  persons include the persons referred to in clause (<em>a</em>) or clause (<em>b</em>),  either for cash or for a consideration other than cash, if the price of such  shares is determined by the valuation report of a registered valuer subject to  such conditions as may be <a href="rule_4.html">prescribed</a>.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) The notice referred  to in sub-clause (<em>i</em>) of clause (<em>a</em>) of sub-section (1) shall be  despatched through registered post or speed post or through electronic mode to  all the existing shareholders at least three days before the opening of the  issue.<br />
</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Nothing in this  section shall apply to the increase of the subscribed capital of a company  caused by the exercise of an option as a term attached to the debentures issued  or loan raised by the company to convert such debentures or loans into shares  in the company:<br />
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that the terms of issue of such debentures or loan containing such  an option have been approved before the issue of such debentures or the raising  of loan by a special resolution passed by the company in general meeting.<br />
</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Notwithstanding  anything contained in sub-section (3), where any debentures have been issued,  or loan has been obtained from any Government by a company, and if that  Government considers it necessary in the public interest so to do, it may, by  order, direct that such debentures or loans or any part thereof shall be  converted into shares in the company on such terms and conditions as appear to  the Government to be reasonable in the circumstances of the case even if terms  of the issue of such debentures or the raising of such loans do not include a  term for providing for an option for such conversion:<br />
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that where the terms and conditions of such conversion are not  acceptable to the company, it may, within sixty days from the date of  communication of such order, appeal to the Tribunal which shall after hearing  the company and the Government pass such order as it deems fit.<br />
</p>
<p align="justify">(5) In determining the  terms and conditions of conversion under sub-section (4), the Government shall  have due regard to the financial position of the company, the terms of issue of  debentures or loans, as the case may be, the rate of interest payable on such  debentures or loans and such other matters as it may consider necessary.<br />
</p>
<p align="justify">(6) Where the Government  has, by an order made under sub-section (4), directed that any debenture or  loan or any part thereof shall be converted into shares in a company and where  no appeal has been preferred to the Tribunal under sub-section (4) or where such  appeal has been dismissed, the memorandum of such company shall, where such  order has the effect of increasing the authorised share capital of the company,  stand altered and the authorised share capital of such company shall stand  increased by an amount equal to the amount of the value of shares which such  debentures or loans or part thereof has been converted into.</p>
