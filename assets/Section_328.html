<h2><a name="_Toc388885270" id="_Toc388885270">328.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraudulent  preference.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) Where a company has given  preference to a person who is one of the creditors of the company or a surety  or guarantor for any of the debts or other liabilities of the company, and the  company does anything or suffers anything done which has the effect of putting  that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into  liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that  thing had not been done prior to six months of making winding up application,  the Tribunal, if satisfied that, such transaction is a fraudulent preference  may order as it may think fit for restoring the position to what it would have  been if the company had not given that preference.<br />
</p>
<p align="justify">(2) If the Tribunal is  satisfied that there is a preference transfer of property, movable or  immovable, or any delivery of goods, payment, execution made, taken or done by  or against a company within six months before making winding up application,  the Tribunal may order as it may think fit and may declare such transaction  invalid and restore the position.<br />
