<p align="justify">(1) Where it appears to  the Central Government that there is a reason so to do, it may appoint one or  more inspectors to investigate and report on matters relating to the company,  and its membership for the purpose of determining the true persons&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) who are  or have been financially interested in the success or failure, whether real or  apparent, of the company; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) who are  or have been able to control or to materially influence the policy of the  company.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) Without prejudice to  its powers under sub-section (1), the Central Government shall appoint one or  more inspectors under that sub-section, if the Tribunal, in the course of any  proceeding before it, directs by an order that the affairs of the company ought  to be investigated as regards the membership of the company and other matters  relating to the company, for the purposes specified in sub-section (1).<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) While appointing an  inspector under sub-section (1), the Central Government may define the scope of  the investigation, whether as respects the matters or the period to which it is  to extend or otherwise, and in particular, may limit the investigation to  matters connected with particular shares or debentures.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Subject to the terms  of appointment of an inspector, his powers shall extend to the investigation of  any circumstances suggesting the existence of any arrangement or understanding  which, though not legally binding, is or was observed or is likely to be  observed in practice and which is relevant for the purposes of his  investigation.</p>
