<h2><a name="_Toc388885205" id="_Toc388885205">264.&nbsp; Implementation of  scheme.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) The Tribunal shall, for the  purpose of effective implementation of the scheme, have power to enforce,  modify or terminate any contract or agreement or any obligation pursuant to  such agreement or contract entered into by the company with any other person.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The Tribunal may, if it  deems necessary or expedient so to do, by order in writing, authorise the  company administrator appointed under section 259 to implement a sanctioned  scheme till its successful implementation on such terms and conditions as may  be specified in the order and may for that purpose require him to file periodic  reports on the implementation of the sanctioned scheme.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Where the whole or  substantial assets of the undertaking of the sick company are sold under a  sanctioned scheme, the sale proceeds shall be applied towards implementation of  the scheme in such manner as the Tribunal may direct:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that debtors and creditors shall have the power  to scrutinise and make an appeal for review of the value before final order of  fixing value.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Where it is difficult to  implement the scheme for any reason or the scheme fails due to  non-implementation of obligations under the scheme by the parties concerned,  the company administrator authorised to implement the scheme and where there is  no such administrator, the company, the secured creditors, or the transferee  company in a case of amalgamation, may make an application before the Tribunal  for modification of the scheme or to declare the scheme as failed and that the  company may be wound up.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(5) The Tribunal shall, within  thirty days of presentation of an application under sub-section (4), pass an  order for modification of the scheme or, as the case may be, declaring the  scheme as failed and pass an order for the winding up of the company if  three-fourths in value of the secured creditors consent to the modification of  the scheme or winding up of the company.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(6) Where an application under  sub-section (<em>4</em>) has been made before the Tribunal and such application  is pending before it, such application shall abate, if the secured creditors  representing not less than three-fourths in value of the amount outstanding  against financial assistance disbursed to the sick company have taken any  measures to recover their secured debt under sub-section (<em>4</em>) of section  13 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement  of Security Interest Act, 2002 (54 of 2002).</p>
