<h2><a name="_Toc388885102" id="_Toc388885102">169.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removal  of directors.</a> </h2>
<p align="justify">(1) A company may, by ordinary  resolution, remove a director, not being a director appointed by the Tribunal  under section 242, before the expiry of the period of his office after giving  him a reasonable opportunity of being heard:<br />
    <strong>Provided</strong> that nothing contained in this sub-section shall  apply where the company has availed itself of the option given to it under  section 163 to appoint not less than two-thirds of the total number of  directors according to the principle of proportional representation.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) A special notice shall be  required of any resolution, to remove a director under this section, or to  appoint somebody in place of a director so removed, at the meeting at which he  is removed.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) On receipt of notice of a  resolution to remove a director under this section, the company shall forthwith  send a copy thereof to the director concerned, and the director, whether or not  he is a member of the company, shall be entitled to be heard on the resolution  at the meeting.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Where notice has been given  of a resolution to remove a director under this section and the director  concerned makes with respect thereto representation in writing to the company  and requests its notification to members of the company, the company shall, if  the time permits it to do so,&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) in any notice of the resolution given  to members of the company, state the fact of the representation having been  made; and<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) send a copy of the representation to  every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is sent (whether  before or after receipt of the representation by the company),<br />
    and if a copy of the  representation is not sent as aforesaid due to insufficient time or for the  company's default, the director may without prejudice to his right to be heard  orally require that the representation shall be read out at the meeting:<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that copy of the representation need not be sent  out and the representation need not be read out at the meeting if, on the  application either of the company or of any other person who claims to be  aggrieved, the Tribunal is satisfied that the rights conferred by this  sub-section are being abused to secure needless publicity for defamatory  matter; and the Tribunal may order the company's costs on the application to be  paid in whole or in part by the director notwithstanding that he is not a party  to it.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(5) A vacancy created by the  removal of a director under this section may, if he had been appointed by the  company in general meeting or by the Board, be filled by the appointment of another  director in his place at the meeting at which he is removed, provided special  notice of the intended appointment has been given under sub-section (2).<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(6) A director so appointed  shall hold office till the date up to which his predecessor would have held  office if he had not been removed.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(7) If the vacancy is not  filled under sub-section (5), it may be filled as a casual vacancy in  accordance with the provisions of this Act:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that the director who was removed from office  shall not be re-appointed as a director by the Board of Directors.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(8) Nothing in this section  shall be taken&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) as depriving a person removed under  this section of any compensation or damages payable to him in respect of the  termination of his appointment as director as per the terms of contract or  terms of his appointment as director, or of any other appointment terminating  with that as director; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) as derogating from any power to remove  a director under other provisions of this Act.</p>
  <h2 align="justify">&nbsp;</h2>
