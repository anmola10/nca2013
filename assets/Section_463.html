<h2><a name="_Toc388885414" id="_Toc388885414">463.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power  of court to grant relief in certain cases.</a> </h2>
<p align="justify">(1) If in any proceeding for  negligence, default, breach of duty, misfeasance or breach of trust against an  officer of a company, it appears to the court hearing the case that he is or  may be liable in respect of the negligence, default, breach of duty,  misfeasance or breach of trust, but that he has acted honestly and reasonably,  and that having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including those  connected with his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused, the court may  relieve him, either wholly or partly, from his liability on such term, as it  may think fit:<br />
    </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that in a criminal proceeding under this  sub-section, the court shall have no power to grant relief from any civil  liability which may attach to an officer in respect of such negligence,  default, breach of duty, misfeasance or breach of trust.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Where any such officer has  reason to apprehend that any proceeding will or might be brought against him in  respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty, misfeasance or breach of  trust, he may apply to the High Court for relief and the High Court on such  application shall have the same power to relieve him as it would have had if it  had been a court before which a proceedings against that officer for  negligence, default, breach of duty, misfeasance or breach of trust had been  brought under sub-section (1).<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) No court shall grant any  relief to any officer under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) unless it has,  by notice served in the manner specified by it, required the Registrar and such  other person, if any, as it thinks necessary, to show cause why such relief  should not be granted.</p>
