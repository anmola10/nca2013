<h2><a name="_Toc388885275" id="_Toc388885275">333.&nbsp; Disclaimer of  onerous property.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) Where any part of the  property of a company which is being wound up consists of&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) land of any tenure, burdened with onerous  covenants;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) shares or stocks in companies;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) any other property which is not  saleable or is not readily saleable by reason of the possessor thereof being  bound either to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum  of money; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>d</em>) unprofitable contracts,
    the Company Liquidator may,  notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the  property or exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto or done anything  in pursuance of the contract, with the leave of the Tribunal and subject to the  provisions of this section, by writing signed by him, at any time within twelve  months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as may  be allowed by the Tribunal, disclaim the property:<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that where the Company Liquidator had not become  aware of the existence of any such property within one month from the  commencement of the winding up, the power of disclaiming the property may be  exercised at any time within twelve months after he has become aware thereof or  such extended period as may be allowed by the Tribunal.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The disclaimer shall  operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest and  liabilities of the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but  shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the  company and the property of the company from liability, affect the rights,  interest or liabilities of any other person.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) The Tribunal, before or on  granting leave to disclaim, may require such notices to be given to persons  interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make  such other order in the matter as the Tribunal considers just and proper.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(4) The Company Liquidator  shall not be entitled to disclaim any property in any case where an application  in writing has been made to him by any person interested in the property  requiring him to decide whether he will or will not disclaim and the Company  Liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days after the receipt of  the application or such extended period as may be allowed by the Tribunal, give  notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Tribunal for leave to  disclaim, and in case the property is under a contract, if the Company Liquidator  after such an application as aforesaid does not within the said period or  extended period disclaim the contract, he shall be deemed to have adopted it.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(5) The Tribunal may, on the  application of any person who is, as against the Company Liquidator, entitled  to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the company,  make an order rescinding the contract on such terms as to payment by or to  either party of damages for the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise  as the Tribunal considers just and proper, and any damages payable under the  order to any such person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding up.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(6) The Tribunal may, on an  application by any person who either claims any interest in any disclaimed  property or is under any liability not discharged under this Act in respect of  any disclaimed property, and after hearing any such persons as it thinks fit,  make an order for the vesting of the property in, or the delivery of the  property to, any person entitled thereto or to whom it may seem just that the  property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as  aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the Tribunal considers  just and proper, and on any such vesting order being made, the property comprised  therein shall vest accordingly in the person named therein in that behalf  without any conveyance or assignment for the purpose:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that where the property disclaimed is of a  leasehold nature, the Tribunal shall not make a vesting order in favour of any  person claiming under the company, whether as under-lessee or as mortgagee or  holder of a charge by way of demise, except upon the terms of making that  person&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) subject to the same liabilities and  obligations as those to which the company was subject under the lease in  respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) if the Tribunal thinks fit, subject  only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned  to that person at that date,<br />
    and in either event as if the  lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order, and any  mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms  shall be excluded from all interest in, and security upon the property, and, if  there is no person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order  upon such terms, the Tribunal shall have power to vest the estate and interest  of the company in the property in any person liable, either personally or in a  representative character, and either alone or jointly with the company, to  perform the covenants of the lessee in the lease, free and discharged from all  estates, encumbrances and interests created therein by the company.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(7) Any person affected by the  operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a creditor  of the company to the amount of the compensation or damages payable in respect  of such effect, and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding  up.</p>
