<p align="justify">(1) The Tribunal may, on  receipt of a petition for winding up under section 272 pass any of the  following orders, namely:&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) dismiss  it, with or without costs;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>) make any  interim order as it thinks fit;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) appoint a  provisional liquidator of the company till the making of a winding up order;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>d</em>) make an  order for the winding up of the company with or without costs; or<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>e</em>) any other  order as it thinks fit:<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Provided</strong> that an order under this sub-section shall be made within ninety  days from the date of presentation of the petition:<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided further</strong> that before appointing a provisional liquidator under clause (<em>c</em>),  the Tribunal shall give notice to the company and afford a reasonable  opportunity to it to make its representations, if any, unless for special  reasons to be recorded in writing, the Tribunal thinks fit to dispense with  such notice:<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Provided also </strong>that the Tribunal shall not refuse to make a winding up order on the  ground only that the assets of the company have been mortgaged for an amount  equal to or in excess of those assets, or that the company has no assets.<br />
  </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Where a petition is  presented on the ground that it is just and equitable that the company should  be wound up, the Tribunal may refuse to make an order of winding up, if it is  of the opinion that some other remedy is available to the petitioners and that  they are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the company wound up instead of  pursuing the other remedy.</p>
