<h2><a name="_Toc388884987" id="_Toc388884987">61. Power  of limited company to alter its share capital.</a></h2>
<p align="justify">(1) A limited company  having a share capital may, if so authorised by its articles, alter its memorandum  in its general meeting to&mdash;<br />
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(<em>a</em>) increase  its authorised share capital by such amount as it thinks expedient;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>b</em>)  consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger <em>amount  than its existing shares:</em><br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Provided </strong>that no consolidation and division which results in  changes in the voting percentage of shareholders shall take effect unless it is  approved by the Tribunal on an application made in the <a href="rule_4.html">prescribed</a> manner;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>c</em>) convert  all or any of its fully paid-up shares into stock, and reconvert that stock  into fully paid-up shares of any denomination;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>d</em>)  sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is  fixed by the memorandum, so, however, that in the sub-division the proportion  between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share  shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced  share is derived;<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">(<em>e</em>) cancel  shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution in that behalf, have  not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of  its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) The cancellation of  shares under sub-section (1) shall not be deemed to be a reduction of share  capital.</p>
